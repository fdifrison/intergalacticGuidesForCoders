## BASIC CONFIG

- install
    > sudo apt install git

- config global user
    > git config --global user.name “Giovanni Frison”
    > git config --global user.email “ing.giovanni.frison@gmail.com”

## SSH KEY

    info @ https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

    * generate ssh key
        > ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "ing.giovanni.frison@gmail.com"
    
    * start agent
        > eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

    * copy ssh key to agent
        > ssh-add ~/.ssh/pyfry_key  (dir_of_the_key/name_of_the_key)

## INITIALIZE FROM LOCAL

    * connect to github with ssh key and first commit from desktop
        > git init
        > git add README.md
        > git commit -m "first commit"
        > git branch -M main
        > git remote add origin git@github.com:fdifrison/PyFry-v1.git
        > git push -u origin main

    * push an existing repository
        > git remote add origin git@github.com:fdifrison/PyFry-v1.git
        > git branch -M main
        > git push -u origin main -> -u stands for --set-upstream

## CLONE A REPO

    git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 foldername

## GIT IGNORE

    * ignore all .a files
        >.a
    * but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
        > !lib.a
    * only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
        > /TODO
    * ignore all files in any directory named build
        > build/
    * ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
        > doc/*.txt
    * ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
        > doc/**/*.pdf

## GIT COMMAND

    * remove a file
        > git rm filename

    * add and commit a modified file that already exists in the repo
        > git commit -am "comment"

    * Undo the last commit made
        > git reset HEAD~1 -> 1 stands for the commit I want to revert to

        alternative:
        > git log -> find and copy the commit-hash you want
        > git reset --hard commit-hash
        
    * check diff in all the branch
        > git diff
    * check diff in a specific file
        > git diff file-name

    * add files to branch
        git add file1 file2 file 3 ..
    * add only specifich changes of the file to have separate commits
        git add -p file1

## GIT BRANCHES

    * check in which branch I am
        > git branch
    
    * change branch and create a new one
        > git checkout -b name-of-new-branch
        > git checkout main -> return to main branch

    * check difference between branches
        > git diff name-of-new-branch

    * delete a branch
        > git branch -d name-of-new-branch

# GitHub Workflow

Following some lessons learned:

- Use Issues! we cna create issues of any type and once resolved they gave us a complete history of the changes done by the commit that worked to close the issue. If in a push comment we declare `Closed #1` (where #1 indicates issue number 1), once pushed the commit to github it will automatically close the issue and by inspecting it we will be able to  see the history of changes
